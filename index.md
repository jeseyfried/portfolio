# Medievalist and Digital Humanist
I research gender, culture, and economics in the late fourteenth-century Crown of Aragon, with a focus on the reign of Joan I and Yolande (Violant) de Bar. I also develop methods for combining historical research with emerging technologies and I am the Managing Director of the University of New Mexico Department of History's [Amaranth Studio for Digital Humanities](https://amaranth-unm.github.io/).

Prior to my current work at the University of New Mexico, I taught history and social studies at the secondary level for fifteen years. Over the years, I have also enjoyed writing speculative fiction and other creative projects.
