### Molt Cara Companyona
A daily podcast coming in 2026! Starting on January 1, I will present a letter or document from each day of the first year of the reign of King Joan I of Aragon and Queen Violant de Bar. They reigned from 1387-1396 and their first tumultuous year included near-death illness, court scandals, and troubadour parties. In addition to learning more about these two fascinating medieval monarchs, listeners will gain an insight into the surprising abundance of the digitized Archives of the Crown of Aragon.

### A Socialist Reads Atlas Shrugged
I created this podcast before starting my current graduate program. The inspiration for it came from how I noticed that Atlas Shrugged operates as a type of ur-text for a lot of Republican Party policies and conservative ideology. Many leftists dismiss the book, and Ayn Rand in general, as unworthy of attention due to Rand's eccentricities and the melodrama of her prose style. However, many people have read Atlas Shrugged and find great value in its ideas. I wanted to explore the arguments in the book and offer a response that would help people to move beyond the caricature of socialism presented in it.
