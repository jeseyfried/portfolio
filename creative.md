# Creative Work
I've dabbled with a handful of creative forms, but year after year I keep coming back to creative writing. My favorite genre for writing is speculative fiction although I did try my hand at historical fiction once. Below are some of my currently available creative pieces.

.bookshelf {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(150px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
  max-width: 1100px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
.bookshelf a {
  display: block;
  transition: transform 0.2s ease;

.bookshelf a:hover {
  transform: scale(1.05);

  box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);

## Other Artsy Things
I occasionally dabble in other art forms, such as 3D-printed sculpture, photography, paper arts, and just a little textile weaving.
